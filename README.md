## ðŸ“¦ Running with Docker

To run the project inside a Docker container:

1. **Ensure Docker is installed and running locally**

   You can download Docker from [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

2. **Build the Docker image**

   ```sh
   docker build -t auth-app .
   
3. ðŸš€ Run the Docker container

## ðŸš€ Running the Project Without Docker

If youâ€™re running this project **outside Docker** (e.g. after cloning the repo), follow these steps:

1. **Switch Node.js version using `nvm`**  
   Make sure you have `nvm` installed, then run:

   ```sh
   nvm use
   
2. Install dependencies using Yarn
Always use Yarn in this workspace:

3. Start the development server with Nx
npx nx serve auth-app

## Run tasks

To run the dev server for your app, use:

```sh
npx nx serve auth-app
```

To create a production bundle:

```sh
npx nx build auth-app
```

To see all available targets to run for a project, run:

```sh
npx nx show project auth-app
```
        
These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

[More about running tasks in the docs &raquo;](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## Add new projects

While you could add new projects to your workspace manually, you might want to leverage [Nx plugins](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) and their [code generation](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) feature.

Use the plugin's generator to create new projects.

To generate a new application, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/angular:app demo
```

To generate a new library, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/angular:lib mylib
```

You can use `npx nx list` to get a list of installed plugins. Then, run `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to learn about more specific capabilities of a particular plugin. Alternatively, [install Nx Console](https://nx.dev/getting-started/editor-setup?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) to browse plugins and generators in your IDE.
